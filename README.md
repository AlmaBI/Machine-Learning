# Machine-Learning

## Learning objectives ##

This course is an intensive introduction to the most widely-used machine learning methods. The first goal is to provide a basic intuitive understanding of these techniques: what they are good for, how they work, how they relate to one another, and their strengths and weaknesses. The second goal is to provide a hands-on feel for these methods through experiments with suitable data sets, using Jupyter notebooks. The third goal is to understand machine learning methods at a deeper level by delving into their mathematical underpinnings. This is crucial to being able to adapt and modify existing methods and to creatively combining them.
